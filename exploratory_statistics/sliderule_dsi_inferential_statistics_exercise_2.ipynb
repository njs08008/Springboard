    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "\n",
    "It is not clear what each column in the data frame precisely represents from the instructions or from the resources.  The website says two high and two low quality resumes were sent to each job posting, but does not saying whether the equal quality ones were identical in all but name.  This point is further complicated by the fact that it says names were randomly assigned, which would seem to imply that, i.e., the two high quality resumes for a single job are only split between a white and black sounding name roughly half the time.\n",
